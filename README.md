# Kotlin Essential Training

These are the solutions to the challenges for the LinkedIn course [**Kotlin Essential Training**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/kotlin-essential-training/)

### [Challenge Chapter 3](src/main/kotlin/challenges/chapter3)
Whenever 'if' expressions get complicated, we prefer to use the 'when' instead because it is easier to understand.\
In this challenge, you need to replace a complicated 'if' with a clean and succinct 'when'.\
The code currently executes and must run and return the same output after you improve it.\
