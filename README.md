# Kotlin Essential Training

These are the solutions to the challenges for the LinkedIn course [**Kotlin Essential Training**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/kotlin-essential-training/)

### [Challenge Chapter 3](src/main/kotlin/challenges/chapter3)
Whenever 'if' expressions get complicated, we prefer to use the 'when' instead because it is easier to understand.\
In this challenge, you need to replace a complicated 'if' with a clean and succinct 'when'.\
The code currently executes and must run and return the same output after you improve it.

### [Challenge Chapter 4](src/main/kotlin/challenges/chapter4)
For this challenge, we have a list of strings, many of which are duplicates.\
Use what you know to render the collection without any duplicates.

### [Challenge Chapter 5](src/main/kotlin/challenges/chapter5)
In the resources directory there is a file sales.txt, which contains a series of floating point numbers, one on each line.\
You must read the numbers in and add them to a list of doubles.\
However, not all the numbers are good, you must filter out any invalid values and then display the list.

### [Challenge Chapter 6](src/main/kotlin/challenges/chapter6)
We've written a function named _replicate_. The function accepts as its sole parameter a function which we must pass to it.\
Read the function's definition and then create a function that matches the definition.\
The function should print message to align ones for each value of count. So if count is five, we should see message displayed on five lines.\
Then, pass the function to replicate. Feel free to use any function type that you'd like.

### [Challenge Chapter 7](src/main/kotlin/challenges/chapter7)
We have created a class named Bosco. We want to keep track of the number of instances that get created.\
When the program begins, there should be zero. Each time we instantiate Bosco, the count should increase by one.\
We aren't concerned about what happens if objects go out of scope. We only want to know how many instances of our Bosco class got instantiated.\
Your implementation must include a show method that shows the number of instances created.\
Test your class implementation against the provided code.
