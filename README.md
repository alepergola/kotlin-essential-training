# Kotlin Essential Training

These are the solutions to the challenges for the LinkedIn course [**Kotlin Essential Training**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/kotlin-essential-training/)

### [Challenge Chapter 3](src/main/kotlin/challenges/chapter3)
Whenever 'if' expressions get complicated, we prefer to use the 'when' instead because it is easier to understand.\
In this challenge, you need to replace a complicated 'if' with a clean and succinct 'when'.\
The code currently executes and must run and return the same output after you improve it.\

### [Challenge Chapter 4](src/main/kotlin/challenges/chapter4)
For this challenge, we have a list of strings, many of which are duplicates.\
Use what you know to render the collection without any duplicates.\

### [Challenge Chapter 5](src/main/kotlin/challenges/chapter5)
In the resources directory there is a file sales.txt, which contains a series of floating point numbers, one on each line.\
You must read the numbers in and add them to a list of doubles. \
However, not all the numbers are good, you must filter out any invalid values and then display the list.\
